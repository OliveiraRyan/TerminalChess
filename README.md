# TerminalChess
Text-based chess game playable in the terminal.

Currently, the game is in development, being created in my free time. After all features are added, my plan is to add online fucntionality with a server/client connection through the usage of sockets.

Let me know if and how you break my code!

**To Be Implemented:**
* Piece movement
  * Movement logic
  * User input
* Player turns
* Win conditions and game logic
* Pawn 2-square first move
* Pawn promotion
* Castling
* En Passant
* Prevent player from entering check
* Online connectivety (sockets)
